 ## A ride share app 

This is an opportunity to practice what I learn this semester.
I am going to build a web app where user ( students during winter break) can see if there are any car available to
rent for short transportation( target, cvs, wegmans)
ALso driver( on campus student job certified) can actually put the time they are able to ride.


Sequence:
Design the system on documentation
Implementation 
Testing
